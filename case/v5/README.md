# Instructions

3D print three STL files from this folder: **Body**, **Lid** and **Face**. You may pick some printing advisories on [my Thingiverse page](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3041339).<br>
If you are unable to print the parts by yourself - you may consider to find an appropriate local 3D service provider and place an order with assistance of [3DHubs portal](http://www.3dhubs.com/).

At first insert printed face panel into front rails. Place T-Beam board into the enclosure's main body. Put lid on top of the assembly. Fasten the lid with four 2.5x10 mm screws.

# GoPro mount option

Two variants of main body are available. One is with GoPro mount and another one is without.
